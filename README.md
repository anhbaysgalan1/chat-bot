This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

Each of the five bots responds with random phrases 1 - 5 seconds after your message. Answer sets for each bot  
It was planned that the robots would respond with phrases with this API ```https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/```  
But it seems there are some server issues right now for these free API  
So if cat-facts api respond with error, robots respond with such phrases:  

> My wife is really mad at the fact that I have no sense of direction. So I packed up my stuff and right!  

> How do you get a squirrel to like you? Act like a nut.  

> Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack each other up.  

> I don't trust stairs. They're always up to something.  

> What do you call someone with no body and no nose? Nobody knows.  

> Did you hear the rumor about butter? Well, I'm not going to spread it!  

> Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired.  

> "Dad, can you put my shoes on?" "No, I don't think they'll fit me."  

> Why can't a nose be 12 inches long? Because then it would be a foot.  

> This graveyard looks overcrowded. People must be dying to get in.
